This website is a frame work for the MtG card usage finder for my case study.
It includes 5 pages with CSS stylings for each and a video in the Rat? page.

The video is implemented with an EventListener when coming to the page which selects the video.
This allows the buttons to find the video in the JS script page.
There is a warning on the video page but just to be certain, the video is loud and features flashing colors.

There is functionality for trying to log in, but the Map doesn't transfer over which makes logging in impossible.
