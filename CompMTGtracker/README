This website is a frame work for the MtG card usage finder for my case study.
It includes 5 pages with CSS stylings for each and a video in the Rat? page.

The video is implemented with an EventListener when coming to the page which selects the video.
This allows the buttons to find the video in the JS script page.
There is a warning on the video page but just to be certain, the video is loud and features flashing colors.

I have not implemented the account page nor the buttons on the login page,
expect for if you try to login with no values in the username and password fields.
